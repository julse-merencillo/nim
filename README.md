This project is a submission for my Programming 1 class. This repository will not be updated, as I feel no need to update this anytime soon.
Feel free to do anything with this code. I hope you have as much fun playing with this (or rewriting it) as I had making it.

Running this project is as simple as cloning the repository, compiling and running Nim.java.
